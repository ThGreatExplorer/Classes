Weeks 1-3 are the mathematical foundations for all the future topics. Thus, I need a solid understanding to be able to
grasp deeper concepts. This is likely going to be the CRUCIAL aspect of learning in this class.

So for Weeks 1-3, I plan to keep up with semi-mandatory textbook readings (despite how difficult they may be) and 
aim to read 1 ML paper or explore ML blog/project or work with 1 ML codebase a week.

1. Read textbook readings
2. 1 ML side-exploreation --> papers, blogs, projects, existing models
